# Check out my updated game for week 2 

I try to redo the coding I learning from the class to switch scenes and add the animation sprites using code to the player's movement.

Some questions about how to add animation with animator setting to the GetKeyDown function. I use GetAxiesRaw, movement.x and movement.y instead.
